**HTML:**
HTML is at the core of every web page, regardless of the complexity of a site or the number of technologies involved. It's an essential skill for any web professional and the starting point for anyone learning how to create content for the web. And, luckily for us, it's surprisingly easy to learn.

**CSS:**
CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. This programming language dictates how the HTML elements of a website should actually appear on the frontend of the page.

**JavaScript:**
JavaScript is a more complicated language than HTML or CSS, and it wasn't released in beta form until 1995. Nowadays, JavaScript is supported by all modern web browsers and is used on almost every site on the web for more powerful and complex functionality.
